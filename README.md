# ArcGIS Mapping for Environmental Impact Studies
This project leverages ArcGIS Pro and various Python libraries to analyze and map environmental data. By utilizing tools such as ArcPy and GDAL, detailed spatial analyses were conducted to visualize environmental impacts effectively. The project involved creating comprehensive maps that showcase the effects of environmental factors on specific regions. This repository includes the scripts and workflows used for data processing, analysis, and map creation.

Technologies Used:

ArcGIS Pro: Used for spatial data analysis and map creation.
Python: Scripts written to automate data processing and analysis.
ArcPy: Python library for interacting with ArcGIS Pro.
GDAL: Library for reading and writing raster and vector geospatial data formats.
